### News Generator using LangGraph , XAI and Groq

Overview
This project is a Top headlines news generation and summarization pipeline built using LangGraph. 
It takes user input (country and news category), validates it using an LLM, fetches the latest news, and generates a concise summary. The system ensures factual accuracy and unbiased reporting.

The workflow follows a state-based approach where:

User input is taken for country & news category.
Validation is performed using an LLM.
If valid, news articles are fetched using a different LLM.
Summarization is done to provide a structured output.
The process re-prompts users if the input is invalid.


Features
âœ… LLM-Powered Validation â€“ Ensures the input country & news category are real and valid.
âœ… State-Based Execution â€“ Uses LangGraph for structured workflow automation.
âœ… News Retrieval â€“ Fetches top 5 unbiased news articles for the given category.
âœ… Summarization â€“ Generates concise, readable news summaries.
âœ… Error Handling â€“ Automatically re-prompts users for incorrect input.
âœ… LangSmith Integration â€“ Enables tracing and debugging of the workflow.

ðŸ›  LangGraph â€“ For managing state-based workflows.
ðŸ›  LangSmith â€“ For debugging and tracing execution.
ðŸ›  ChatXAI â€“ Used for news retrieval.
ðŸ›  ChatGroq (Qwen-2.5-32b) â€“ Used for input validation & summarization.
